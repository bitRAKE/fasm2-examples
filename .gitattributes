# "linguist-detectable=false" don't collect stats on language
# I don't really like any of the highlighters, but here it can be changed:
#*.asm    linguist-language=Assembly
*.inc    linguist-language=Assembly

# post-fixed file with '.g' i.e. test.asm.g, test.inc.g
*.g      linguist-language=Assembly
